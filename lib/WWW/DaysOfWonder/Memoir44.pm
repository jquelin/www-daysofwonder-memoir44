=head1 DESCRIPTION

Memoir'44 is a unique historical game edited by L<Days of
Wonder|http://www.daysofwonder.com>, where players command a horde of
little plastic Army men facing-off in dozens of WWII battles on an
oversize hex game board. Each battle scenario mimics the historical
terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Deploying forces
through a variety of Command cards, the smart commander uses the unique
skills of his units - infantry, paratroopers, tanks, artillery,
commandos and resistance fighters - to its greatest strength.

The game comes with some bundled scenarios, but there are a lot more
available online. This module allows one to list and retrieve those
officials and non-officials scenarios.

Don't use this module directly, but check the L<mem44> command for an
easy to use way of fetching the scenarios.
